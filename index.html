          I feel nostalgic for the good old days when avocado toast was something novel, a little breakfast secret to share with friends.
          Avocado toast these days, well, it's gone mainstream. But that doesn't mean we should take it for granted. Avocados are a water-hungry
          crop, and with drought conditions being what they are, this wonderful fruit could get rarer and more expensive in the days ahead. So,
          make that avocado toast count. Every slice should be extra special!

          Here are 11 delicious ways to upgrade your toast into a breakfast treat that is worthy of the avocado itself. And all you need are
          two ingredients to make any one of these fancied-up avocado toasts.
